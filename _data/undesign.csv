COVID-19 in New York City: An Ecology of Race and Class Oppression. Springer Briefs in Public Health.","This book is the first social epidemiological study of COVID-19 spread in New York City (NYC), the primary epicenter of the United States. New York City spread COVID-19 throughout the United States. The context of epicenter formation determined the rapid, extreme rise of NYC case and mortality rates. Decades of public policies destructive of poor neighborhoods of color heavily determined the spread within the City. Premature mortality rates revealed the ""weathering"" of policy-targeted communities: accelerated aging due to chronic stress. COVID attacks the elderly more severely than those under the age of 60. Communities with high proportions of prematurely aged residents proved fertile ground for COVID illness and mortality. The very public policies that created swaths of white wealth across much of Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn destroyed the human diversity needed to ride out crises.

 Topics covered within the chapters include:
 Premature Death Rate Geography in New York City: Implications for COVID-19
 NYC COVID Markers at the ZIP Code Level
 Prospero's New Castles: COVID Infection and Premature Mortality in the NY Metro Region

Only recently purchased and made available by the Beinecke Library at Yale University, Campbell's map has been largely ignored by art historians of The Harlem Renaissance and American modernism. As a visual document of the interracial nightlife that characterized Harlem in the early twentieth-century, however, the map offers us new information regarding the way the physical space of Harlem became abstracted into a signification for both white and black New Yorkers. In the following pages I attempt to draw out the ways that Campbell illustrates Harlem as a space that has the ability to both cement white voyeurs' membership in a modern intelligentsia and foment black ontologies of resistance. In doing so, the social history of racialized space in Manhattan, slumming, and cartography will also be considered. I aim to describe how Campbell's map represents Harlem as a neighborhood that is comprised of white and black identity formation where both both races were able to construct subjectivities simultaneously and often in opposition to one another.",182,undesign_item,/img/derivatives/simple/s183/thumbnail.jpg,/img/derivatives/simple/s183/fullwidth.jpg
