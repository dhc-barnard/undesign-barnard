In this 1943 Harlem riot, Polite confronted a police officer in a public place at the inception of the riot. Conflicting accounts of Polite's role in the riot are found in police reports, the white press, the black press, sociological accounts such as Dominic J. Capeci, Jr.'s The Harlem Riot of 1943, and Langston Hughes's poem, “The Ballad of Margie Polite,” published two months after the riot. In some of these accounts, Polite is cast in traditional feminine roles, while in others she is responsible for starting the riot. In fact, Margie Polite alerted America to Harlem's rage over systemic inequalities.

The recent expression of this DNA in policies of serial forced displacement and mass incarceration have, it has been argued, created a voracious machine of community destruction that is widening its reach from the initial victims in the African American community to much wider segments of the US population.

Historically, in the United States, the way planners, politicians, and developers have answered this question has followed an insidious pattern, in which those who live in housing that’s vulnerable to the spread of an illness are themselves pathologized, and then displaced. The flawed housing is demolished and rebuilt to be more hygienic, but priced to exclude its former residents, who must again find shelter in dangerous housing.""",027,undesign_item,/img/derivatives/simple/s123/thumbnail.jpg,/img/derivatives/simple/s123/fullwidth.jpg

In turning to the category of the report at the heart of this material, I argue that neighborhood observation at midcentury was an inherently racialized act that not only responded to race but changed the ways it was counted and valued. Focusing on three types of reports—a series of appraisal manuals designed to train burgeoning appraisers in racial reading, Jane Jacobs's Death and Life of Great American Cities (1961), and Gwendolyn Brooks's urban reportage, ""They Call It Bronzeville"" (1951), questioning the mechanics of neighborhood observation in the wake of its professionalization—I insist that the story of how systems of neighborhood and racial appraisal shaped one another is not just one for historians and urbanists to tell. It is also, fundamentally, a story about how idioms of perception, value, and taste undergirding home ownership and neighborhood value in the United States have been organized by race.",035,undesign_item,/img/derivatives/simple/s130/thumbnail.jpg,/img/derivatives/simple/s130/fullwidth.jpg

Narrators describe the social and legal efforts to hold back powerful interests whose urban redevelopment plans stood to displace residents.

Today, public health departments can employ multiple strategies to improve housing, such as developing and enforcing housing guidelines and codes, implementing “Healthy Homes” programs to improve indoor environmental quality, assessing housing conditions, and advocating for healthy, affordable housing.

Only recently purchased and made available by the Beinecke Library at Yale University, Campbell's map has been largely ignored by art historians of The Harlem Renaissance and American modernism. As a visual document of the interracial nightlife that characterized Harlem in the early twentieth-century, however, the map offers us new information regarding the way the physical space of Harlem became abstracted into a signification for both white and black New Yorkers. In the following pages I attempt to draw out the ways that Campbell illustrates Harlem as a space that has the ability to both cement white voyeurs' membership in a modern intelligentsia and foment black ontologies of resistance. In doing so, the social history of racialized space in Manhattan, slumming, and cartography will also be considered. I aim to describe how Campbell's map represents Harlem as a neighborhood that is comprised of white and black identity formation where both both races were able to construct subjectivities simultaneously and often in opposition to one another.",093,undesign_item,/img/derivatives/simple/s183/thumbnail.jpg,/img/derivatives/simple/s183/fullwidth.jpg

The interviews have a special focus on two episodes in the building's history. The first is when tenants worked in the late 1960s to fight a city-approved redevelopment plan, backed by Columbia University and others, to level their block to build an old-age home. Narrators describe the social and legal efforts to hold back powerful interests whose urban redevelopment plans stood to displace residents. The second episode is when tenants banded together in 1979 to form a co-op and purchase the building from their landlord before it was sold to an unknown outside purchaser. Narrators discuss the legal process of forming a co-op, financial challenges, and social dynamics within the building. Narrators also describe the neighborhood of Morningside Heights from the 1960s to 2016. Issues addressed include economic and cultural demographics of the area over the decades; crime in the 1960s-1970s; community organizations and activism; and the gentrification of the neighborhood of the 2010s.

Many scholars focus on the infusion of capital, real estate, and employment opportunities that these anchor institutions bring to their respective communities, often minority neighborhoods, which have been marked by decades of government disinvestment. However, these narratives of economic rejuvenation obscure the ways in which anchor institutions displace long-term African-American residents. This dissertation examines how Columbia University’s Manhattanville Project has increased the speed and scope of the gentrification processes in West Harlem. By analyzing landmark legal cases related to eminent domain law and newspaper articles revealing undisclosed deals between Columbia and New York State officials, I trace the various avenues through which this institution has flexed its political power in order to realize its expansion project. I argue that Columbia has engaged in various ethically questionable practices in order to acquire the land for the purpose of its Manhattanville project and that these tactics mirror strategies employed by corporations when pursuing their interests: they both are defined by their severe lack of consideration for the social and economic havoc that low-income and minority residents suffer as a result of their actions...",185,undesign_item,/img/derivatives/simple/s268/thumbnail.jpg,/img/derivatives/simple/s268/fullwidth.jpg

This article examines the discourses, debates and politics surrounding the project and, in particular, the University’s demand for exclusive control of the site and ultimate pursuit of eminent domain. To that end, university officials claimed that the expansion would bolster the city’s knowledge based economy and, as a conse- quence, serve the “public good”—a requirement for the exercise of eminent domain.

She was an unofficial Morningside Park historian and wrote articles about the park for the local newspaper, The Westsider.

Dolnick 2010), the Cross-Bronx Expressway is known as one of the busiest roads in the United States (cp. ibid.). As its name already suggests, it runs across New York City’s borough of the Bronx. It is one of the major roads in the New York area and notorious for its congestion and the poor state it is in (cp ibid.). Most importantly, though, is that it is said to have been a major influence on the borough of the Bronx. Not only is it today regarded by many as an atrocity (see quote above), it is also claimed that the expressway is to blame for a negative development the area was subject to on a highly dramatic scale during the last century (cp. Dolnick 2010.). Then again, there are other voices that deny a link between the expressway’s construction and the downfall of the borough. The controversy that is thereby created will be the main issue of this paper. It will be dealing with the question whether any statements can be made regarding a connection between the expressway and the desolate state the Bronx was in during the middle of the last century. The following three chapters will be dedicated to give the information necessary to answer this issue, with respect to three major topics.
