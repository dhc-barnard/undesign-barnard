COVID-19 in New York City: An Ecology of Race and Class Oppression. Springer Briefs in Public Health.","This book is the first social epidemiological study of COVID-19 spread in New York City (NYC), the primary epicenter of the United States. New York City spread COVID-19 throughout the United States. The context of epicenter formation determined the rapid, extreme rise of NYC case and mortality rates. Decades of public policies destructive of poor neighborhoods of color heavily determined the spread within the City. Premature mortality rates revealed the ""weathering"" of policy-targeted communities: accelerated aging due to chronic stress. COVID attacks the elderly more severely than those under the age of 60. Communities with high proportions of prematurely aged residents proved fertile ground for COVID illness and mortality. The very public policies that created swaths of white wealth across much of Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn destroyed the human diversity needed to ride out crises.

 Topics covered within the chapters include:
 Premature Death Rate Geography in New York City: Implications for COVID-19
 NYC COVID Markers at the ZIP Code Level
 Prospero's New Castles: COVID Infection and Premature Mortality in the NY Metro Region
 Pandemic Firefighting vs. Pandemic Fire Prevention

Addressing housing issues offers public health practitioners an opportunity to address an important social determinant of health. Public health has long been involved in housing issues. In the 19th century, health officials targeted poor sanitation, crowding, and inadequate ventilation to reduce infectious diseases as well as fire hazards to decrease injuries. Today, public health departments can employ multiple strategies to improve housing, such as developing and enforcing housing guidelines and codes, implementing “Healthy Homes” programs to improve indoor environmental quality, assessing housing conditions, and advocating for healthy, affordable housing. Now is the time for public health to create healthier homes by confronting substandard housing."

Prior analyses have shown health inequities across these boroughs, but whether similar patterns have also emerged amid the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown.4 Understanding the patterns could inform public health and policy strategies to mitigate the ongoing spread of COVID-19, and future approaches to address a possible resurgence of the disease. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to examine population characteristics and hospital bed capacities across the 5 boroughs and evaluate whether differences in the rates of COVID-19 testing, hospitalizations, and deaths have emerged in these communities."

Vanessa,s183,Friends and Strangers: E. Simms Campbell’s Mapping of a Multiracial Harlem,Blake Oetting,Bowdoin Journal of Art,2018,,student project,https://www.academia.edu/download/56351392/Oetting__Friends_and_Strangers__Bowdoin2018_Final_Word_Document.pdf,,savoy-ballroom,"Oetting, Blake. 2018. ""Friends and Strangers: E. Simms Campbell’s Mapping of a Multiracial Harlem"" in Bowdoin Journal of Art , Vol. IV.","This paper investigates ""A Night-Club Map of Harlem,"" illustrated by E. Simms Campbell in 1932. Only recently purchased and made available by the Beinecke Library at Yale University, Campbell's map has been largely ignored by art historians of The Harlem Renaissance and American modernism. As a visual document of the interracial nightlife that characterized Harlem in the early twentieth-century, however, the map offers us new information regarding the way the physical space of Harlem became abstracted into a signification for both white and black New Yorkers. In the following pages I attempt to draw out the ways that Campbell illustrates Harlem as a space that has the ability to both cement white voyeurs' membership in a modern intelligentsia and foment black ontologies of resistance. In doing so, the social history of racialized space in Manhattan, slumming, and cartography will also be considered. I aim to describe how Campbell's map represents Harlem as a neighborhood that is comprised of white and black identity formation where both both races were able to construct subjectivities simultaneously and often in opposition to one another."
