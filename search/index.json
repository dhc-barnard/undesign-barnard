It tells the story of how an unparalleled cohort of ethnic minority students earned degrees from a world-class university. The story takes place in New York City at Columbia University’s School of Architecture and spans a decade of institutional evolution that mirrored the emergence and denouement of the Black Power Movement. Chronicling a surprisingly little-known era in U.S. educational, architectural, and urban history, the book traces an evolutionary arc that begins with an unsettling effort to end Columbia’s exercise of authoritarian power on campus and in the community, and ends with an equally unsettling return to the status quo.

Focusing on four iconic \"Manhattan projects\"--the United Nations building, Stuyvesant Town, Lincoln Center, and the great swaths of public housing in East Harlem--Zipp unearths a host of forgotten stories and characters that flesh out the conventional history of urban renewal. He shows how boosters hoped to make Manhattan the capital of modernity and a symbol of American power, but even as the builders executed their plans, a chorus of critics revealed the dark side of those Cold War visions, attacking urban renewal for perpetuating deindustrialization, racial segregation, and class division; for uprooting thousands, and for implanting a new, alienating cityscape. Cold War-era urban renewal was not merely a failed planning ideal, Zipp concludes, but also a crucial phase in the transformation of New York into both a world city and one mired in urban crisis...",

Only recently purchased and made available by the Beinecke Library at Yale University, Campbell's map has been largely ignored by art historians of The Harlem Renaissance and American modernism. As a visual document of the interracial nightlife that characterized Harlem in the early twentieth-century, however, the map offers us new information regarding the way the physical space of Harlem became abstracted into a signification for both white and black New Yorkers. In the following pages I attempt to draw out the ways that Campbell illustrates Harlem as a space that has the ability to both cement white voyeurs' membership in a modern intelligentsia and foment black ontologies of resistance. In doing so, the social history of racialized space in Manhattan, slumming, and cartography will also be considered. I aim to describe how Campbell's map represents Harlem as a neighborhood that is comprised of white and black identity formation where both both races were able to construct subjectivities simultaneously and often in opposition to one another.",

Through eye-opening conversations with city leaders, low-wage workers tending to students’ needs, and local activists fighting encroachment, scholar Davarian L. Baldwin makes clear who benefits from unchecked university power—and who is made vulnerable. In the Shadow of the Ivory Tower is a wake-up call to the reality that higher education is no longer the ubiquitous public good it was once thought to be. But as Baldwin shows, there is an alternative vision for urban life, one that necessitates a more equitable relationship between our cities and our universities. (Bold Type Books)",

The materials in this collection were gathered by Christiane Crasemann Collins and her husband, Professor George R. Collins, long-time residents of Morningside Heights. Mrs. Collins, an art librarian at the Parsons School of Design (1973-1983), was an active member of the West Side Coalition for Morningside Park. Due to her deep-seated interest in the community's welfare and human rights issues, and her professional specialization in architectural history, she was convinced that the events as they were occurring in Morningside Heights were significant and that it was her \"duty\" to document the upheavals which took place during this period. She was an unofficial Morningside Park historian and wrote articles about the park for the local newspaper, The Westsider. Dr. George Collins, professor of art history and an architectural historian at Columbia University, was involved in community and university relations as early as the mid-1950s, when he began protesting Columbia's expansionist plans. He also became an active member of the University Senate's Committee on Community Relations following the upheavals in the spring of 1968. Professor Collins retired from Columbia University in approximately 1986...",

As its name already suggests, it runs across New York City’s borough of the Bronx. It is one of the major roads in the New York area and notorious for its congestion and the poor state it is in (cp ibid.). Most importantly, though, is that it is said to have been a major influence on the borough of the Bronx. Not only is it today regarded by many as an atrocity (see quote above), it is also claimed that the expressway is to blame for a negative development the area was subject to on a highly dramatic scale during the last century (cp. Dolnick 2010.). Then again, there are other voices that deny a link between the expressway’s construction and the downfall of the borough. The controversy that is thereby created will be the main issue of this paper. It will be dealing with the question whether any statements can be made regarding a connection between the expressway and the desolate state the Bronx was in during the middle of the last century. The following three chapters will be dedicated to give the information necessary to answer this issue, with respect to three major topics. In combination, this knowledge will be needed later, when different opinions and theories regarding the link between the Cross-Bronx Expressway and the negative development the Bronx underwent will be examined...",

Examining riot events across eras reveals how ethical principles at the core of democracy are undermined in specific socio-historical contexts—especially equality of participation in collective self-governance. Congressional testimony, state-sponsored riot investigations, and archival data indicate that riots have been used historically to structure racial inequality in both political institutions and economic relations...",

Dean J. Franco probes how race is formed and transformed in literature and in everyday life, in the works of Helena María Viramontes, Paul Beatty, James Baldwin, and the writers of the Watts Writers Workshop. Exploring metaphor and metonymy, as well as economic and political circumstance, Franco identifies the potential for reconciliation in the figure of the neighbor, an identity that is grounded by geographical boundaries and which invites their crossing.

    "description": "Although dramatic scenes of residential integration abound within midcentury American fiction, this essay makes the case for attending to less spectacular narratives of residential segregation, including forms, manuals, and maps that captured the more impersonal processes of observation used to uphold the more generally steady-state of US residential apartheid. In turning to the category of the report at the heart of this material, I argue that neighborhood observation at midcentury was an inherently racialized act that not only responded to race but changed the ways it was counted and valued. Focusing on three types of reports—a series of appraisal manuals designed to train burgeoning appraisers in racial reading, Jane Jacobs's Death and Life of Great American Cities (1961), and Gwendolyn Brooks's urban reportage, \"They Call It Bronzeville\" (1951), questioning the mechanics of neighborhood observation in the wake of its professionalization—I insist that the story of how systems of neighborhood and racial appraisal shaped one another is not just one for historians and urbanists to tell. It is also, fundamentally, a story about how idioms of perception, value, and taste undergirding home ownership and neighborhood value in the United States have been organized by race.",

    "description": "The Saving the Blennerhasset oral history collection documents the history of a tenant-owned co-op located at 507 West 111th Street in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of New York City. The interviews have a special focus on two episodes in the building's history. The first is when tenants worked in the late 1960s to fight a city-approved redevelopment plan, backed by Columbia University and others, to level their block to build an old-age home. Narrators describe the social and legal efforts to hold back powerful interests whose urban redevelopment plans stood to displace residents. The second episode is when tenants banded together in 1979 to form a co-op and purchase the building from their landlord before it was sold to an unknown outside purchaser. Narrators discuss the legal process of forming a co-op, financial challenges, and social dynamics within the building. Narrators also describe the neighborhood of Morningside Heights from the 1960s to 2016. Issues addressed include economic and cultural demographics of the area over the decades; crime in the 1960s-1970s; community organizations and activism; and the gentrification of the neighborhood of the 2010s. The collection also addresses life in the building more generally, as narrators recall personalities in the building, maintaining the building, childhood activities on the block, and the camaraderie and challenges of apartment living. The interviews were conducted by Tom Phillips for a 55-page piece called \"Saving the Blennerhasset.\" The collection's interviews are comprised of digital transcripts, paper-based transcripts, and digital audio The collection's narrators are Nellie Bailey, Don Colflesh, Wendell Dorris, George Gabriel, Demi McGuire, and Deland Rivera.

In A World More Concrete, N. D. B. Connolly uses the history of South Florida to unearth an older and far more complex story. Connolly captures nearly eighty years of political and land transactions to reveal how real estate and redevelopment created and preserved metropolitan growth and racial peace under white supremacy. Using a materialist approach, he offers a long view of capitalism and the color line, following much of the money that made land taking and Jim Crow segregation profitable and preferred approaches to governing cities throughout the twentieth century.

    "description": "During the post–World War II era, Columbia University undertook a bold and comprehensive expansion and redevelopment initiative to remake their immediate surroundings. Drawing upon the language of Cold War anticommunism, the university—in partnership with such redevelopment groups as Morningside Heights Inc.—undertook such a self-proclaimed ‘‘war on blight’’ in an attempt to ‘‘liberate’’ the surrounding community from the horrors of urban decay. This essay positions the 1968 student–community campaign against a proposed gymnasium in Morningside Park within this longer narrative of university-sponsored urban renewal. In light of such a history, those that campaigned against the university’s expansion efforts also adopted a language clearly influenced by the imagery of warfare in the mid-twentieth century: the language of anticolonialism. ..",

Many scholars focus on the infusion of capital, real estate, and employment opportunities that these anchor institutions bring to their respective communities, often minority neighborhoods, which have been marked by decades of government disinvestment. However, these narratives of economic rejuvenation obscure the ways in which anchor institutions displace long-term African-American residents. This dissertation examines how Columbia University’s Manhattanville Project has increased the speed and scope of the gentrification processes in West Harlem. By analyzing landmark legal cases related to eminent domain law and newspaper articles revealing undisclosed deals between Columbia and New York State officials, I trace the various avenues through which this institution has flexed its political power in order to realize its expansion project. I argue that Columbia has engaged in various ethically questionable practices in order to acquire the land for the purpose of its Manhattanville project and that these tactics mirror strategies employed by corporations when pursuing their interests: they both are defined by their severe lack of consideration for the social and economic havoc that low-income and minority residents suffer as a result of their actions...",

Members of our CLIMB Consensus Group – neighbors of all ages and walks of life, students, researchers, organizational leaders, and even a few dogs – have contributed to CLIMB and Hike the Heights since 2004. In the spirit of our community potluck approach – where everyone brings something to add to the celebration – we asked CLIMB Consensus Group members from over the years to share their stories, thoughts, and reflections. This book is the result.",

The Weeksville Society emerged from a workshop called Project Weeksville: an archaeological survey of the Weeksville community by local college students, neighborhood youth and volunteers that began in 1968 under the direction of Pratt Institute professor, James Hurley. Medgar Evers College eventually became the home of Project Weeksville where Rodney Toney and Mary Ann Brown served as Project Directors (Maynard, J. & Cottman, G., 1983). Mrs. Brown created the oral history program, with the goal of documenting and preserving Black history in the Bedford Stuyvesant area.",

In the 19th century, health officials targeted poor sanitation, crowding, and inadequate ventilation to reduce infectious diseases as well as fire hazards to decrease injuries. Today, public health departments can employ multiple strategies to improve housing, such as developing and enforcing housing guidelines and codes, implementing “Healthy Homes” programs to improve indoor environmental quality, assessing housing conditions, and advocating for healthy, affordable housing.

    "description": "An investigation of the significant role that the black woman Margie Polite played in the Harlem riot of 1943, during which 6 African-Americans were killed and 180 people were injured. In this 1943 Harlem riot, Polite confronted a police officer in a public place at the inception of the riot. Conflicting accounts of Polite's role in the riot are found in police reports, the white press, the black press, sociological accounts such as Dominic J. Capeci, Jr.'s The Harlem Riot of 1943, and Langston Hughes's poem, “The Ballad of Margie Polite,” published two months after the riot. In some of these accounts, Polite is cast in traditional feminine roles, while in others she is responsible for starting the riot. In fact, Margie Polite alerted America to Harlem's rage over systemic inequalities. Her protest and resistance sparked the violence of the riot, and her ex post facto silencing is illustrative of a general erasure of African-American women's participation in the pubic sphere.",

The interviews have a special focus on two episodes in the building's history. The first is when tenants worked in the late 1960s to fight a city-approved redevelopment plan, backed by Columbia University and others, to level their block to build an old-age home. Narrators describe the social and legal efforts to hold back powerful interests whose urban redevelopment plans stood to displace residents. The second episode is when tenants banded together in 1979 to form a co-op and purchase the building from their landlord before it was sold to an unknown outside purchaser. Narrators discuss the legal process of forming a co-op, financial challenges, and social dynamics within the building. Narrators also describe the neighborhood of Morningside Heights from the 1960s to 2016.",

Housing developers, federal agencies, and real-estate associations used a eugenically informed racial hierarchy to justify redlining and preferential home loans that discriminated against African Americans and immigrants. Reframing this history from a feminist perspective, I argue that these practices were intended as a form of eugenic regulation that enforced women's role as reproducers. This reproductive agenda contributed to a legacy of race-based discrimination in housing, and disparities in wealth that resulted from those differences.",

Both of these city archives were working to digitize and make available 17th-century records related to New Amsterdam, the Dutch settlement on the southern tip of Manhattan that would become New York City. A joint project was suggested by Russell Shorto, encouraged by the New Netherland Institute, and facilitated by the Dutch consulate. New Amsterdam Stories was born, a platform to share each archives' efforts to document the stories of the people of New Amsterdam. The project set in motion a unique shared cultural-heritage partnership seeking to bring archival collections to wider audiences and to establish opportunities for greater research, knowledge-sharing, and storytelling. We hope to serve as a model for access and interpretation of digital heritage collections. (NYC Dept of Records)",

Racially restrictive covenants—which barred the conveyance of property to African Americans—were used by real estate developers and white citizens associations to create and maintain racial barriers. Mapping Segregation is a resource for historians, activists, educators, students, and journalists, and provides essential context for conversations around race and gentrification in DC. The ongoing, lot-by-lot documentation of racial covenants is set in the context of DC's demographic transformation over the course of several decades. Primary documents, archival news clippings, photographs, and oral testimony also contribute to the stories these maps tell.",

This online film series highlights a variety of films past and present that have dramatized the plight of those who wage a daily battle for safe and secure housing, that have unveiled the structural and economic forces that render that struggle so difficult, and that have chronicled the efforts of activists to make change.

While the pandemic’s economic impacts would be the trigger, this crisis would be rooted in an older problem: the risky approach to real estate finance adopted by many New York landlords and investors over the past 25 years. Even though the real estate market is cyclical, New York State does not have to follow the post-2008 crisis trajectory. This report investigates how, with intervention from policymakers, we can pursue a recovery that both stabilizes distressed buildings and grows the state’s social housing sector, a model that is not as susceptible to fluctuations in the real estate market.",

Completed in 2009, this film takes its viewers on a historical journey which depicts the economic transition of 125th street from the late 1960's to present day. Mart 125 is used as a metaphor which examines the plague of perplexities that surround this unique black community and its relationship with the plans of urban renewal from a commercial stand point. Harlem's Mart 125: the American Dream portrays a microcosmic analysis of the displacement of Black American communities today. This is a story that takes an introspective look at the changing face of the most well known African-American neighborhood and a complexity of issues that surround this community in peril!

In the spring of 1950, his parents met in secret with 25 other families to create Better Homes of South Bend. Their efforts would later become a collection of homes on the 1700 and 1800 blocks of N. Elmer St. But today, the value of those houses doesn’t match the work it took to put them there. This week: what these family stories of housing in the “heartland” say about inequity in home ownership today.",

    "description": "First published by the Historical Society of Pennsylvania in 1818, History, Manners, and Customs of the Indian Nations provides an account of the Lenni Lenape and other tribes in the mid-Atlantic region, looking at their history and relations with other tribes and settlers, as well as their spiritual beliefs, government and politics, education, language, social institutions, dress, food, and other customs. The text, written by the Reverend John Heckewelder, a Moravian missionary based in Ohio and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, includes the author’s observations, anecdotes, and advice, preserving not only his knowledge about the Indian nations in the eighteenth century but also his perspective, as a missionary and settler, on Native Americans and the often-fraught relationships between the tribes and European settlers. This version of the text, published in 1876, contains an introduction and notes by the Reverend William C. Reichel as well as a glossary of Lenape words and phrases and letters between the author and the then-president of the American Philosophical Society concerning the study of the Indian nations and their languages.

These towns used everything from legal formalities to violence to create homogenous Caucasian communities—and their existence has gone unexamined until now. For the first time, Loewen takes a long, hard look at the history, sociology, and continued existence of these towns, contributing an essential new chapter to the study of American race relations.

The first Black people in Harlem, both freed and enslaved, worked on farms in the area known as Niew Haarlem. New Haarlem was formally established as a settlement by Peter Stuyvesant in 1658 and was named after the Dutch city of Haarlem. For generations, the sole connection between Niew Haarlem and Niew Amsterdam was a diagonal road built on an old Native path: a street we now call Broadway…",

Redlined neighborhoods, which remain lower-income and more likely to have Black or Hispanic residents, consistently have far fewer trees and parks that help cool the air. They also have more paved surfaces, such as asphalt lots or nearby highways, that absorb and radiate heat.\"",

It is generally recognized that the ability to recover is not infinite and depends on initial conditions of the material that is stressed. Mindy proposes to set initial conditions for community recovery from climate change with the creation of the US Constitution, which enshrined that provision that slaves be counted as 3/5's of a person, making racism the \"DNA of the nation.\" The recent expression of this DNA in policies of serial forced displacement and mass incarceration have, it has been argued, created a voracious machine of community destruction that is widening its reach from the initial victims in the African American community to much wider segments of the US population. This machine can push the ecosystem towards a permanent state of criminal enterprise hyperviolence, such as that seen in some parts of Mexico and Italy. Mindy suggests that remedies to climate change will be driven by this powerful social system, but other alternatives exist and should be pursued",

The University’s expansion plan called for the acquisition and demolition of all but three buildings in the project’s footprint and the construction of a state of the art campus over a roughly 30-year period. This article examines the discourses, debates and politics surrounding the project and, in particular, the University’s demand for exclusive control of the site and ultimate pursuit of eminent domain. To that end, university officials claimed that the expansion would bolster the city’s knowledge based economy and, as a conse- quence, serve the “public good”—a requirement for the exercise of eminent domain. By contrast, critics of the project argued for a mixed-use redevelopment plan that would include affordable housing and other community-defined amenities...
