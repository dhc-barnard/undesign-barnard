The __#Undesign@Barnard Syllabus__ is a project supported by the [Barnard Digital Humanities Center](https://digitalhumanities.barnard.edu/). We will be using [__Wax__](https://minicomp.github.io/wiki/#/wax/) to create a digital archive of contributions to the collaborative syllabus which is part of the Undesign the Redline learning community at Barnard.
