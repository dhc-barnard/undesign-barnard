The __Undesign the Redline @ Barnard__ is an interactive exhibition combining history, art, and storytelling with community outreach and collaboration in order to reckon with systemic racism by examining the legacy of redlining in Barnard and Columbia's neighborhood. Working with [Designing the WE](http://www.designingthewe.com/undesign-the-redline), a local social design studio, members of Barnard's neighborhood, including faculty, students, and unaffiliated community members, will create a collaborative exhbition tracing the history of redlining in Morningside Heights and Harlem to its present day legacies.

The __#Undesign@Barnard Syllabus__ is a project supported by the [Barnard Digital Humanities Center](https://digitalhumanities.barnard.edu/). We will be using [__Wax__](https://minicomp.github.io/wiki/#/wax/) to create a digital archive of contributions to the collaborative syllabus which is part of the __Undesign the Redline @ Barnard__ learning community.
