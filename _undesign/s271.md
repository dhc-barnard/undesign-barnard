description: First published by the Historical Society of Pennsylvania in 1818, History,
  Manners, and Customs of the Indian Nations provides an account of the Lenni Lenape
  and other tribes in the mid-Atlantic region, looking at their history and relations
  with other tribes and settlers, as well as their spiritual beliefs, government and
  politics, education, language, social institutions, dress, food, and other customs.
  The text, written by the Reverend John Heckewelder, a Moravian missionary based
  in Ohio and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, includes the authorâ€™s observations, anecdotes,
  and advice, preserving not only his knowledge about the Indian nations in the eighteenth
  century but also his perspective, as a missionary and settler, on Native Americans
  and the often-fraught relationships between the tribes and European settlers. This
  version of the text, published in 1876, contains an introduction and notes by the
  Reverend William C. Reichel as well as a glossary of Lenape words and phrases and
  letters between the author and the then-president of the American Philosophical
  Society concerning the study of the Indian nations and their languages. (Penn State
  University Press)
