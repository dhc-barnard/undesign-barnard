description: Samuel Stein shows that this explosive transformation of urban life and
  politics has been driven not only by the tastes of wealthy newcomers, but by the
  state-led process of urban planning. Planning agencies provide a unique window into
  the ways the state uses and is used by capital, and the means by which urban renovations
  are translated into rising real estate values and rising rents. Capital City explains
  the role of planners in the real estate state, as well as the remarkable power of
  planning to reclaim urban life.
