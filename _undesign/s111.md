description: This Resource Guide is the outcome of a Summer Institute on Methodologies
  for Housing Justice convened by the Institute on Inequality and Democracy at UCLA
  Luskin as part of the Housing Justice in Unequal Cities Network, which is supported
  by the National Science Foundation (BCS 1758774). Held in Los Angeles in August
  2019, the Summer Institute brought together participants from cities around the
  world. As is the case with the overall scope and purpose of the Housing Justice
  in Unequal Cities Network, it created a shared terrain of scholarship for movement-based
  and university-based scholars.
