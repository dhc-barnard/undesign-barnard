description: Culturally Sustaining Pedagogies raises fundamental questions about the
  purpose of schooling in changing societies. Bringing together an intergenerational
  group of prominent educators and researchers, this volume engages and extends the
  concept of culturally sustaining pedagogy (CSP)―teaching that perpetuates and fosters
  linguistic, literate, and cultural pluralism as part of schooling for positive social
  transformation. (Teachers College Press)
