description: 'Historically, Weeksville’s oral history program was conceptualized by
  Mary Ann Brown as…”a realistic and viable method used to record the life experiences
  of residents of a specific community.” Mary Ann Brown was the Research Coordinator
  for Project Weeksville in 1973. The Weeksville Society emerged from a workshop called
  Project Weeksville: an archaeological survey of the Weeksville community by local
  college students, neighborhood youth and volunteers that began in 1968 under the
  direction of Pratt Institute professor, James Hurley. Medgar Evers College eventually
  became the home of Project Weeksville where Rodney Toney and Mary Ann Brown served
  as Project Directors (Maynard, J. & Cottman, G., 1983). Mrs. Brown created the oral
  history program, with the goal of documenting and preserving Black history in the
  Bedford Stuyvesant area.'
