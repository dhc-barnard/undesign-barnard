description: Fifty years after the federal Fair Housing Act banned racial discrimination
  in lending, African Americans and Latinos continue to be routinely denied conventional
  mortgage loans at rates far higher than their white counterparts. This modern-day
  redlining persisted in 61 metro areas even when controlling for applicants’ income,
  loan amount and neighborhood, according to a mountain of Home Mortgage Disclosure
  Act records analyzed by Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting.
