description: Scholars of English from across the US, most specializing in African-American
  literature, examine the literary representation of racial segregation in the country.
  Their overall themes are the aesthetic challenges of Jim Crow politics, imagining
  and subverting Jim Crow in Charles Chesnutt's segregation fiction, inside Jim Crow
  and his doubles, exporting Jim Crow, and Jim Crow's legacy. (SUNY Press)
