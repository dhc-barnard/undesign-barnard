description: 'Mike Jackson, like many descendants of the Great Migration, has a family
  home that was built from protest, resilience and ingenuity. In the spring of 1950,
  his parents met in secret with 25 other families to create Better Homes of South
  Bend. Their efforts would later become a collection of homes on the 1700 and 1800
  blocks of N. Elmer St. But today, the value of those houses doesn’t match the work
  it took to put them there. This week: what these family stories of housing in the
  “heartland” say about inequity in home ownership today.'
