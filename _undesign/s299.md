description: The New Amsterdam Stories project began as a collaboration between the
  New York City Municipal Archives and the Stadsarchief Amsterdam. Both of these city
  archives were working to digitize and make available 17th-century records related
  to New Amsterdam, the Dutch settlement on the southern tip of Manhattan that would
  become New York City. A joint project was suggested by Russell Shorto, encouraged
  by the New Netherland Institute, and facilitated by the Dutch consulate. New Amsterdam
  Stories was born, a platform to share each archives' efforts to document the stories
  of the people of New Amsterdam. The project set in motion a unique shared cultural-heritage
  partnership seeking to bring archival collections to wider audiences and to establish
  opportunities for greater research, knowledge-sharing, and storytelling. We hope
  to serve as a model for access and interpretation of digital heritage collections.
