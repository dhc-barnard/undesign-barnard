description: Due to the intricate nature of this document, it is suggested that those
  interested in the source read it in it's entirety. Essentially, the 2018-2019 political
  committe of the BSO asseses the racially violnt history of Columbia Public Safety
  (and subsequentially, Columbia University and Barnard College). This particular
  document was witten, spurred by the racially motivated Public Safety incidient,
  where Alexander McNab, a black Columbia Student, was wrongfully harassed and physically
  assulted for entering Barnard's Campus. The document then goes onto adress the University's
  past with racial violence both on campus, and in the greater Harlem/Morningside
  area. The incidents speak to the influence of redlining, as determining what events
  foster a response from public safety, is related to the social and urban status
  of non-white Harlem residents.
