description: The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene is implementing an Equity
  Action Plan to advance equitable policies and practices in the City’s COVID-19 response.
  The plan uses focused messaging and increased engagement with community and health
  care partners in neighborhoods with a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 cases,
  hospitalizations and deaths. We recognize that underinvestment in these neighborhoods
  and structural racism are risk factors for COVID-19.
