description: The Welikia Project is a result of decades long work, as teams of researchers
  from all relevant fields worked to uncover and represent the original ecology of
  the entire city. "Welikia" means "my good home" in Lenape, which is a tribute to
  the land NYC occupies, from the original inhabitors of the Lenape people, Native
  Americans. The Welikia Project encompasses an impressive amount of data and maps,
  made easily acessible to the general public.
