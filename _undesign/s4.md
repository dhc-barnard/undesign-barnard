description: 400 Years of Inequality is a diverse coalition of organizations and individuals
  calling on everyone - families, friends, communities, institutions - to plan their
  own solemn observance of 1619, learn about their own stories and local places, and
  organize for a more just and equal future. We are dedicated to dismantling structural
  inequality and building strong, healthy communities.
