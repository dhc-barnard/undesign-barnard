description: Inspired by the idea that we cannot address the inequities of the present
  without an understanding of the past, Mapping Prejudice was created to expose the
  racist practices that reshaped the landscape of Minneapolis. People of color see
  how discriminatory practices cascade through their lives, erecting barriers that
  limit access to housing, credit, education, and wealth. But the resulting physical,
  emotional, and financial baggage has been harder to recognize for people who have
  not personally experienced racism. Mapping Prejudice seeks to make these burdens
  visible by locating them on a digital, interactive map. The project team was inspired
  by a desire to create the first-ever comprehensive map of racial covenants for an
  American community.
