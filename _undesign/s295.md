description: The New York City Community Health Profiles capture the health of 59
  community districts across the city. They contain over 50 measures of neighborhood
  health, emphasizing that our health starts where we live, work and play. These reports
  highlight the disparities among neighborhoods and can be used by policymakers, community
  groups, health professionals, researchers and residents to encourage community engagement
  and action. (Dept of Health)
