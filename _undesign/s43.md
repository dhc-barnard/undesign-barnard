description: 'From website: "Cities for People, Not for Profit: Gentrification and
  Housing Activism in Bushwick is an oral history project tracing the history of ongoing
  gentrification and subsequent fight for affordable housing in Bushwick, Brooklyn
  from the perspective of artists, activists, and community residents. Oral history
  can be used as an entry point to explore what Henri Lefebvre famously termed the
  citizen’s “right to the city” and to explore how these narratives can respond to
  rampant real estate growth and housing policy. The goal is to have these stories
  posted online alongside informative tools and resources to help activate the community,
  such as alternative housing strategies, locating activist organizations and fair
  housing efforts in the area."'
