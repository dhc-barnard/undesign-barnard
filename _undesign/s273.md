description: 'The Christiane C. Collins Collection of the West Harlem Coalition for
  Morningside Park and Urban Problems of the Contiguous Communities: West Harlem,
  Manhattan Valley, Morningside Heights and Manhattanville documents Columbia University''s
  expansionist plans in Manhattan''s Morningside Heights and Morningside Park, and
  subsequent protests on the part of the community and students in the 1960s and 1970s,
  with the aftermath extending into the 1980s. The materials in this collection were
  gathered by Christiane Crasemann Collins and her husband, Professor George R. Collins,
  long-time residents of Morningside Heights. Mrs. Collins, an art librarian at the
  Parsons School of Design (1973-1983), was an active member of the West Side Coalition
  for Morningside Park. Due to her deep-seated interest in the community''s welfare
  and human rights issues, and her professional specialization in architectural history,
  she was convinced that the events as they were occurring in Morningside Heights
  were significant and that it was her "duty" to document the upheavals which took
  place during this period. She was an unofficial Morningside Park historian and wrote
  articles about the park for the local newspaper, The Westsider. Dr. George Collins,
  professor of art history and an architectural historian at Columbia University,
  was involved in community and university relations as early as the mid-1950s, when
  he began protesting Columbia''s expansionist plans. He also became an active member
  of the University Senate''s Committee on Community Relations following the upheavals
  in the spring of 1968. Professor Collins retired from Columbia University in approximately
  1986...'
