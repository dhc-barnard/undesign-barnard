description: The Last Neighborhood Cops reveals the forgotten history of the residents
  and cops who forged community policing in the public housing complexes of New York
  City during the second half of the twentieth century. Through a combination of poignant
  storytelling and historical analysis, Fritz Umbach draws on buried and confidential
  police records and voices of retired officers and older residents to help explore
  the rise and fall of the HAPDâ€™s community-based strategy, while questioning its
  tactical effectiveness. (Rutgers Univ. Press)
