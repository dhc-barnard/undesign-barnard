description: The toolkit includes a guide, a wall chart, and an interactive, online
  map. The phrase “affordable housing” seems plain enough, but it doesn’t always mean
  what people think it does. It actually has a technical definition, which can determine
  what gets built and who gets to live there. The Affordable Housing Toolkit helps
  communities answer the all-important question, “Affordable to whom?" The Center
  for Urban Pedagogy (CUP) is a nonprofit organization that uses the power of design
  and art to increase meaningful civic engagement particularly among underrepresented
  communities. CUP projects demystify the urban policy and planning issues that impact
  our communities, so that more individuals can better participate in shaping them.
