description: Ron is interested in what happens when we consider the radical potential
  held within everyday materials? Their current research + artistic practice look
  at various historic and diasporic technologies that black people have used to signify
  and encode sanctuary within hostile spaces. Focusing on mobility and absence, Ron
  is concerned with residual data articulated through everyday objects left behind
  in the aftermath of movement. This talk hopes to highlight some of the limitations
  of using geospatial data to redress racialized violence within urban landscapes
  and points to the need for embodied practices that yield different spatial imaginaries
  (Eyeo Festival 2019).
