description: 'Given the basic existential nature of the human need for shelter – and
  the extent to which housing policy in many societies reflects, embodies, and perpetuates
  economic exploitation, structural racism, and the destructive toll of unchecked
  capitalism – it’s no surprise that filmmakers have explored the topic, both directly
  and indirectly, throughout the history of the medium. This online film series highlights
  a variety of films past and present that have dramatized the plight of those who
  wage a daily battle for safe and secure housing, that have unveiled the structural
  and economic forces that render that struggle so difficult, and that have chronicled
  the efforts of activists to make change. (Anthology Film Archives). Christopher
