description: Ten years since the economic recession, lending has returned for many
  Americans. Yet the gap between white and black homeownership is wider now than it
  was in 1960, with signs of modern-day redlining showing up across the country. Special
  correspondent Aaron Glantz reports as part of a year-long investigation by Reveal
  from The Center for Investigative Reporting.
