description: Set in London in the 1960’s, when the UK encouraged its Commonwealth
  citizens to emigrate as a result of the post-war labor shortage, The Housing Lark
  explores the Caribbean migrant experience in the “Mother Country” by following a
  group of friends as they attempt to buy a home together. Despite encountering a
  racist and predatory rental market, the friends scheme, often comically, to find
  a literal and figurative place of their own. (Penguin)
