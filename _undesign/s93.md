description: Upon the US electoral victory of real estate mogul Donald Trump, we at
  the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project (AEMP)–a data visualization, data analysis, and
  storytelling collective that documents the dispossession and resistance of San Francisco
  Bay Area residents within contemporary landscapes of gentrification–have been newly
  theorizing relationships of power, property, race, and displacement. In this piece
  we think through what it means that a New York City real estate mogul now is President
  of the United States.
