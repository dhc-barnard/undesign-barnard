description: 'When McGhee asks, at the outset, “Why can’t Americans have nice things?”
  she means the basics: good roads, well-funded schools, affordable health care, decent
  housing, clear air and water, jobs that pay a living wage. We can’t have nice things
  because white America would rather go without than invite Black America in.Why can’t
  we be more like the Scandinavian countries, with their enviable education systems,
  parental leave benefits, and overall quality of life? Because, argues McGhee, “unlike
  the United States, Finland didn’t have mass slavery and genocide to cut their empathic
  cord at the country’s birth.” Racism hurts everyone.'
