description: THE FUNAMBULIST IS A PLATFORM THAT ENGAGES WITH THE POLITICS OF SPACE
  AND BODIES. Our hope is to provide a useful platform where activist/academic/practitioner
  voices can meet and build solidarities across geographical scales. Through articles,
  interviews, artworks, and design projects, we are assembling an ongoing archive
  for anticolonial, antiracist, queer, and feminist struggles (The Funambulist).
