description: In this dynamic book, Stefan M. Bradley describes the impact of Black
  Power ideology on the Students' Afro-American Society (SAS) at Columbia. While white
  students--led by Mark Rudd and Students for a Democratic Society (SDS)--sought to
  radicalize the student body and restructure the university, black students focused
  on stopping the construction of the gym in Morningside Park. Through separate, militant
  action, black students and the black community stood up to the power of an Ivy League
  institution and stopped it from trampling over its relatively poor and powerless
  neighbors (University of Illinois Press).
