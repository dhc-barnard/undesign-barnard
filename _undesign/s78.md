description: Harlem Solidarity & Defense (HSD) is a mass organization, meaning that
  we seek to constantly incite and organize the masses of people around issues that
  affect them.HSD moves with the understanding that organization and genuine community
  power are the only solutions to the oppression faced by Black and Brown working-class
  people in Harlem, New York, and the world. HSD follows a model of collective power,
  democracy, and centralism to address issues that are affecting the working people
  of Harlem. We understand that organizing is the backbone to powerful communities,
  and that powerful communities are the only defense against oppression (Harlem Solidarity
  and Defense).
