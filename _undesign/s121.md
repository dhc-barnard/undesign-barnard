description: This chapter closely reads the testimonial records of the Haitian Centers
  Council cases and focuses on the refugeesâ€™ means of challenging their imprisonment
  and demanding recognition as rightful subjects. It examines how they asserted their
  voices by organizing the Association des Refugies Politiques Haitiens and through
  individual interactions, collective town hall meetings, and letters. Despite these
  efforts, they remained unheard and unrecognized as proper subjects of human rights.
  They therefore turned to increasingly assertive, embodied communicative acts, eventually
  organizing a hunger strike that conveyed their demands more powerfully than their
  words alone.
