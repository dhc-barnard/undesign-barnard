description: Kathy's family left on a Saturday morning in 1965. The rumble of bulldozers
  echoed through the neighborhood, and her block was empty. Federally-funded urban
  renewal had arrived in Charlottesville, scattering dozens of families like Kathy's.
  The once-vibrant African American community, built by formerly enslaved men and
  women who had secured a long-denied piece of the American dream, disappeared. (Field
  Studios)
