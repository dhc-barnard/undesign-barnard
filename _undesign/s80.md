description: Heat waves in the United States kill more people during a typical year
  than all other natural disasters combined. Until now, no one could explain either
  the overwhelming number or the heartbreaking manner of the deaths resulting from
  the 1995 Chicago heat wave. Meteorologists and medical scientists have been unable
  to account for the scale of the trauma, and political officials have puzzled over
  the sources of the city’s vulnerability. In Heat Wave, Eric Klinenberg takes us
  inside the anatomy of the metropolis to conduct what he calls a “social autopsy,”
  examining the social, political, and institutional organs of the city that made
  this urban disaster so much worse than it ought to have been (UChicago Press).
