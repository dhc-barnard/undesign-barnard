description: This book is the first social epidemiological study of COVID-19 spread
  in New York City (NYC), the primary epicenter of the United States. New York City
  spread COVID-19 throughout the United States. The context of epicenter formation
  determined the rapid, extreme rise of NYC case and mortality rates. Decades of public
  policies destructive of poor neighborhoods of color heavily determined the spread
  within the City. (Springer Briefs)
