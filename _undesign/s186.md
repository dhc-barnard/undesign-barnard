description: Before being torn down in 2007, the Stateway Gardens public housing projects
  on Chicago’s South Side were ridden with deprivation and crime. But for some, like
  Tracy, the shy, intelligent young boy at the center of this enthralling collection
  of linked stories, they are simply home. Set in the mid-1980s and taking readers
  up to the point of the destruction of the infamous Cabrini-Green housing projects—a
  set of buildings similar in design to Stateway Gardens to the south—this collection
  gives an intimate look at the hopes, dreams, failures, and fortunes of a group of
  people growing up with the deck always stacked against them. Through Jasmon Drain’s
  sensitive and often playful prose, we see another side of what we have come to know
  as “the projects.” (Random House)
