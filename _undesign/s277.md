description: Moving beyond the usual good-versus-evil story that pits master-planner
  Robert Moses against the plucky neighborhood advocate Jane Jacobs, Samuel Zipp sheds
  new light on the rise and fall of New York's urban renewal in the decades after
  World War II. Focusing on four iconic "Manhattan projects"--the United Nations building,
  Stuyvesant Town, Lincoln Center, and the great swaths of public housing in East
  Harlem--Zipp unearths a host of forgotten stories and characters that flesh out
  the conventional history of urban renewal. He shows how boosters hoped to make Manhattan
  the capital of modernity and a symbol of American power, but even as the builders
  executed their plans, a chorus of critics revealed the dark side of those Cold War
  visions, attacking urban renewal for perpetuating deindustrialization, racial segregation,
  and class division; for uprooting thousands, and for implanting a new, alienating
  cityscape. Cold War-era urban renewal was not merely a failed planning ideal, Zipp
  concludes, but also a crucial phase in the transformation of New York into both
  a world city and one mired in urban crisis...
