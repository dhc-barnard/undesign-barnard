description: What if divided neighborhoods were causing public health problems? What
  if a new approach to planning and design could tackle both the built environment
  and collective well-being at the same time? What if cities could help each other?
  Dr. Mindy Thompson Fullilove uses her unique perspective as a public health psychiatrist
  to explore ways of healing social and spatial fractures simultaneously.
