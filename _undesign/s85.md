description: 'Excerpt: "Across more than 100 cities, a recent study found, formerly
  redlined neighborhoods are today 5 degrees hotter in summer, on average, than areas
  once favored for housing loans, with some cities seeing differences as large as
  12 degrees. Redlined neighborhoods, which remain lower-income and more likely to
  have Black or Hispanic residents, consistently have far fewer trees and parks that
  help cool the air. They also have more paved surfaces, such as asphalt lots or nearby
  highways, that absorb and radiate heat."'
