description: 'From article: "Last year marked 50 years since the founding El Comité-MINP
  (Movimiento de Izquierda Nacional Puertorriqueño), a radical socialist movement
  that would last throughout the 1970s and into the early part of the 1980s. Former
  members held a virtual commemoration hosted by the People’s Forum, which included
  panels, performances, and presentations, as well as a screening of Rompiendo Puertas
  (Break and Enter) a 1971 documentary produced by Third World Newsreel that focuses
  on Operation Move-In and the early housing reclamation movement in New York City."'
