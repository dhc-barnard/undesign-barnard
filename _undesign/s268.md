description: 'Universities and colleges throughout America are becoming increasingly
  key players in the economic, political, and social development of urban neighborhoods.
  Many scholars focus on the infusion of capital, real estate, and employment opportunities
  that these anchor institutions bring to their respective communities, often minority
  neighborhoods, which have been marked by decades of government disinvestment. However,
  these narratives of economic rejuvenation obscure the ways in which anchor institutions
  displace long-term African-American residents. This dissertation examines how Columbia
  University’s Manhattanville Project has increased the speed and scope of the gentrification
  processes in West Harlem. By analyzing landmark legal cases related to eminent domain
  law and newspaper articles revealing undisclosed deals between Columbia and New
  York State officials, I trace the various avenues through which this institution
  has flexed its political power in order to realize its expansion project. I argue
  that Columbia has engaged in various ethically questionable practices in order to
  acquire the land for the purpose of its Manhattanville project and that these tactics
  mirror strategies employed by corporations when pursuing their interests: they both
  are defined by their severe lack of consideration for the social and economic havoc
  that low-income and minority residents suffer as a result of their actions...'
