description: 'Created over a 9 year-span, Harlem''s Mart 125: the American Dream is
  a documentary film about the history of Mart 125 and how it correlates to the "revitalization"
  of 125th street, Harlem''s main commercial sector. Completed in 2009, this film
  takes its viewers on a historical journey which depicts the economic transition
  of 125th street from the late 1960''s to present day. Mart 125 is used as a metaphor
  which examines the plague of perplexities that surround this unique black community
  and its relationship with the plans of urban renewal from a commercial stand point.
  Harlem''s Mart 125: the American Dream portrays a microcosmic analysis of the displacement
  of Black American communities today. This is a story that takes an introspective
  look at the changing face of the most well known African-American neighborhood and
  a complexity of issues that surround this community in peril! (Harlem Mart 125)'
