description: 'From CU Archives finding aid: "The Morningside Area Alliance is an organization
  working for community improvement on behalf of its member institutions in the Morningside
  Heights neighborhood in New York City. The organization was founded as Morningside
  Heights Inc. in 1947 through joint action of fourteen Morningside Institutions--Columbia
  University, St. Luke''s Hospital, Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, Teacher''s
  College, Barnard College, Corpus Christi Church, Home for Old Men and Aged Couples,
  International House, Jewish Theological Seminary, Juilliard School of Music, St.
  Hilda''s and St. Hugh''s School, The Riverside Church, Union Theological Seminary,
  and the Women''s Hospital of St. Luke''s Center--with the expressed purpose of "[promoting]
  the improvement of Morningside Heights as an attractive, residential, educational,
  and cultural area." The collection includes much, if not all, of the material that
  was created by the organization as part of its daily business from 1947 to 1992,
  when the materials were accessioned into University Archives at Columbia University."'
