description: Many people characterize urban renewal projects and the power of eminent
  domain as two of the most widely despised and often racist tools for reshaping American
  cities in the postwar period. In A World More Concrete, N. D. B. Connolly uses the
  history of South Florida to unearth an older and far more complex story. Connolly
  captures nearly eighty years of political and land transactions to reveal how real
  estate and redevelopment created and preserved metropolitan growth and racial peace
  under white supremacy. Using a materialist approach, he offers a long view of capitalism
  and the color line, following much of the money that made land taking and Jim Crow
  segregation profitable and preferred approaches to governing cities throughout the
  twentieth century. (Univ. Chicago Press)
