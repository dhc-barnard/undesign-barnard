description: 'From chapter: "What is a course? What is a class? What is a community?
  What is the relationship between those three questions and an even more basic one
  that is rarely asked in higher education: How do we learn? It is our conviction
  that, to address the literacies we need to thrive in the 21st century, we first
  need to step back and think about the conventions of education that we have inherited
  and to ask the big “why” and “how” questions of those conventions."'
