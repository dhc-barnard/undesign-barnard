description: In 2018, to mark the 400th anniversary of the first recorded arrival
  of enslaved Africans to American shores, Mindy Fullilove worked with her class at
  the New School to create a timeline of inequality in the United States, incorporating
  the narratives of a range of marginalized groups. Their purpose was to visualize
  the ecology of inequality, situating its stories in time and space—in specific neighborhoods,
  laws, events, moments—and making the connections between them explicit in the hope
  of turning things around. "If we're in this ecology of inequality," she asks, "What
  do you think an ecology of equality would look like?"
