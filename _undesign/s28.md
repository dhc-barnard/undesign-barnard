description: 'From publisher site: "Set in Brooklyn during the Great Depression and
  World War II, Brown Girl, Brownstones chronicles the efforts of Barbadian immigrants
  to surmount poverty and racism and to make their new country home. Selina Boyce
  is torn between the opposing aspirations of her parents: her hardworking, ambitious
  mother longs to buy a brownstone row house while her easygoing father prefers to
  dream of effortless success and his native islandâ€™s lushness."'
