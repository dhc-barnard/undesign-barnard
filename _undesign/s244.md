description: 'The map and charts here show the number of families that cities reported
  displacing through federally-funded urban renewal programs between 1955 and 1966.
  The urban renewal projects that resulted in displacements were typically aimed at
  "slum clearance": using eminent domain to acquire private homes that were usually
  deemed sub-standard, razing those houses, and redeveloping the land for new, sometimes
  public housing, more often private, or for other purposes like the development of
  department stores or office buildings.'
