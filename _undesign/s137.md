description: In this book Rose Muzio analyzes how structural and historical factors—including
  colonialism, economic marginalization, racial discrimination, and the Black and
  Brown Power movements of the 1960s—influenced young Puerto Ricans to reject mainstream
  ideas about political incorporation and join others in struggles against perceived
  injustices. This analysis provides the first in-depth account of the origins, evolution,
  achievements, and failures of El Comité-Movimiento de Izquierda Nacional Puertorriqueño,
  one of the main organizations of the Puerto Rican Left in the 1970s in New York
  City. (SUNY Press)
