description: The Saving the Blennerhasset oral history collection documents the history
  of a tenant-owned co-op located at 507 West 111th Street in the Morningside Heights
  neighborhood of New York City. The interviews have a special focus on two episodes
  in the building's history. The first is when tenants worked in the late 1960s to
  fight a city-approved redevelopment plan, backed by Columbia University and others,
  to level their block to build an old-age home. Narrators describe the social and
  legal efforts to hold back powerful interests whose urban redevelopment plans stood
  to displace residents. The second episode is when tenants banded together in 1979
  to form a co-op and purchase the building from their landlord before it was sold
  to an unknown outside purchaser. Narrators discuss the legal process of forming
  a co-op, financial challenges, and social dynamics within the building. Narrators
  also describe the neighborhood of Morningside Heights from the 1960s to 2016. Issues
  addressed include economic and cultural demographics of the area over the decades;
  crime in the 1960s-1970s; community organizations and activism; and the gentrification
  of the neighborhood of the 2010s. The collection also addresses life in the building
  more generally, as narrators recall personalities in the building, maintaining the
  building, childhood activities on the block, and the camaraderie and challenges
  of apartment living. The interviews were conducted by Tom Phillips for a 55-page
  piece called "Saving the Blennerhasset." The collection's interviews are comprised
  of digital transcripts, paper-based transcripts, and digital audio The collection's
  narrators are Nellie Bailey, Don Colflesh, Wendell Dorris, George Gabriel, Demi
  McGuire, and Deland Rivera. (Columbia Center for Oral History)
