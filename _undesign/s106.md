description: Mapping Inequality brings one of the country's most important archives
  to the public. HOLC's documents contain a wealth of information about how government
  officials, lenders, and real estate interests surveyed and ensured the economic
  health of American cities. And with the help of ongoing research, we continue to
  learn at what cost such measures were realized. Mapping Inequality was created through
  the collaboration of three teams at four universities (University of Richmond, Virginia
  Tech, University of Maryland, Johns Hopkins University).
