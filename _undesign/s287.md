  truly affordable and quality housing, good health care, resources to advance our
  contributions to arts and culture, community centers, open green spaces, good schools
  with adequate resources, jobs with livable wages, a transformative justice approach
  to public safety, and participatory decision-making for public policies and community
  development...
