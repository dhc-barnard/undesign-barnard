description: Marie Runyon was an activist and former New York State legislator. Born
  in North Carolina in 1915, she moved to Morningside Heights and in 1963 began a
  decades long fight against Columbia University over its real estate practices and
  expansion in the neighborhood. Runyon founded the Morningside Tenants Committee
  as well as other tenants' organizations, and she brought a number of cases to court
  to prevent her eviction from her apartment at 130 Morningside Drive. The collection
  contains the papers of Marie Runyon, relating to her tenant organizing and fight
  against Columbia's expansion in Morningside Heights as well as to her other political
  work and personal life...
