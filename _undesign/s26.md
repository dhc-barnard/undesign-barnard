description: Black Wealth / White Wealth offers a powerful portrait of racial inequality
  based on an analysis of private wealth. Melvin Oliver and Thomas Shapiro's groundbreaking
  research analyzes wealth - total assets and debts rather than income alone - to
  uncover deep and persistent racial inequality in America, and they show how public
  policies have failed to redress the problem.
