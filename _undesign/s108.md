description: Mapping Segregation in Washington DC reveals the profound role of race
  in shaping the nation's capital during the first half of the 20th century. Racially
  restrictive covenants—which barred the conveyance of property to African Americans—were
  used by real estate developers and white citizens associations to create and maintain
  racial barriers. Mapping Segregation is a resource for historians, activists, educators,
  students, and journalists, and provides essential context for conversations around
  race and gentrification in DC. The ongoing, lot-by-lot documentation of racial covenants
  is set in the context of DC's demographic transformation over the course of several
  decades. Primary documents, archival news clippings, photographs, and oral testimony
  also contribute to the stories these maps tell.
