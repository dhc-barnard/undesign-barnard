description: The Yellow House speaks to the nature of neglect, poverty, and belonging,
  as the story accounts as the author's memoir. The book adresses the tension of familial
  relations, that can occur alongside, and as a result, of housing insecurity and
  preconviced notions what 'home' is. The book ultimately explores what aferomentioned
  emotions descrution and 'home' can provide.
