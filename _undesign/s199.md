description: 'Exploding the myth of de facto segregation arising from private prejudice
  or the unintended consequences of economic forces, Rothstein describes how the American
  government systematically imposed residential segregation: with undisguised racial
  zoning; public housing that purposefully segregated previously mixed communities;
  subsidies for builders to create whites-only suburbs; tax exemptions for institutions
  that enforced segregation; and support for violent resistance to African Americans
  in white neighborhoods. A groundbreaking, “virtually indispensable” study that has
  already transformed our understanding of twentieth-century urban history (Chicago
  Daily Observer), The Color of Law forces us to face the obligation to remedy our
  unconstitutional past. (Liveright)'
