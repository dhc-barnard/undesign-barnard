description: Set in 1953, Them follows a black family who, during the Second Great
  Migration, moves from North Carolina to an all-white neighborhood in Los Angeles.
  The family's idyllic home slowly transforms into an epicenter of evil forces, next-door
  and otherworldly, that threaten to haunt, ravage and destroy them. In this video
  , Ayorinde and Thomas discuss the physically draining but emotionally rewarding
  experience of filming Them, as well as the deeper symbolic meanings of their character
  names.
