description: Like a sequel to the prescient warnings of urbanist Jane Jacobs, Dr.
  Mindy Thompson Fullilove reveals the disturbing outcome of decades of urban renewal
  projects to communities of color. For those whose homes and neighborhoods were bulldozed,
  the urban modernization projects that swept America starting in 1949 were nothing
  short of an assault. Vibrant city blocks--places rich in culture--were torn apart
  by freeways and other invasive development, blatantly devastating the lives of poor
  residents. Fullilove passionately describes the profound traumatic stress--the "root
  shock"--that results when a neighborhood is demolished. (New Village Press)
