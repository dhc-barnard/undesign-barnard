description: 'Excerpt from report by Giuliani and Bratton: "In the coming years, Police
  Strategy No. 5: Reclaiming the Public Spaces of New York will emerge as the linchpin
  of efforts now being undertaken by the New York Police Department to reduce crime
  and fear in the city. By working systematically and assertively to reduce the level
  of disorder in the city, the NYPD will act to undercut the ground on which more
  serious crimes seem possible and even permissible."'
