description: The Saving the Blennerhasset oral history collection documents the history
  of a tenant-owned co-op located at 507 West 111th Street in the Morningside Heights
  neighborhood of New York City. The interviews have a special focus on two episodes
  in the building's history. The first is when tenants worked in the late 1960s to
  fight a city-approved redevelopment plan, backed by Columbia University and others,
  to level their block to build an old-age home. Narrators describe the social and
  legal efforts to hold back powerful interests whose urban redevelopment plans stood
  to displace residents. The second episode is when tenants banded together in 1979
  to form a co-op and purchase the building from their landlord before it was sold
  to an unknown outside purchaser. Narrators discuss the legal process of forming
  a co-op, financial challenges, and social dynamics within the building. Narrators
  also describe the neighborhood of Morningside Heights from the 1960s to 2016.
