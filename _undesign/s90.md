description: "“This volume documents the present crisis in American urban housing
  policies and portrays how artists, through the medium of a Dia Foundation–sponsored
  art event and within the context of neighborhood organizations, have fought against
  government neglect, shortsighted housing policies and unfettered real estate speculation.
  Through essays, photographs, symposiums, arthictectural plans and the reproduction
  of works from the series of exhibitions organized by Rosler, the book serves a number
  of functions: it’s a practical manual for community organizing; a history of housing
  and homelessness in New York City and around the country; and an outline of what
  a humane housing policy might encompass for the American city.” —Publishers Weekly
