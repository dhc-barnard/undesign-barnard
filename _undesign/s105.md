description: 'The purpose of FUTURESLAB.COMMUNITY is to document shared memories,
  histories, and futures of communities in Brewerytown-Sharswood and the larger North
  Philly community. The stories on this site grew out of a project called Community
  Futurisms: Time & Memory in North Philly, a collaborative art, preservation, and
  creative research project exploring the impact of redevelopment, gentrification,
  and displacement in North Philly through the themes of oral histories/futures, memories,
  temporalities, and afrofuturism.'
