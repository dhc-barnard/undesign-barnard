description: Wilkerson rigorously defines eight pillars that underlie caste systems
  across civilizations, including divine will, heredity, and dehumanization. She documents
  the parallels with two other hierarchies in history, those of India and of Nazi
  Germany, and no reader will be left without a greater understanding of the price
  we all pay in a society torn by artificial divisions. “The hierarchy of caste is
  not about feelings or morality,” Wilkerson writes. “It is about power — which groups
  have it and which do not.”
