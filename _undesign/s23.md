description: In the past decade, Rebecca Solnit, Rebecca Snedeker, and Joshua Jelly-Schapiro—aided
  by local writers, artists, historians, urbanists, ethnographers, and cartographers—have
  compiled three atlases that have radically changed the way we think about place.
  Each atlas provides a vivid, complex look at the multi-faceted nature of a city—San
  Francisco, New Orleans, and New York—as experienced by its different inhabitants,
  replete with the celebrations and contradictions that make up urban life.
