description: American eugenicists in the 1930s saw housing programs as a vehicle for
  a new form of reproductive regulation promoting large families for the so-called
  fit while limiting family size among the so-called unfit. Housing developers, federal
  agencies, and real-estate associations used a eugenically informed racial hierarchy
  to justify redlining and preferential home loans that discriminated against African
  Americans and immigrants. Reframing this history from a feminist perspective, I
  argue that these practices were intended as a form of eugenic regulation that enforced
  women's role as reproducers. This reproductive agenda contributed to a legacy of
  race-based discrimination in housing, and disparities in wealth that resulted from
  those differences.
