description: Why is New York facing a shortage of hospital beds during the current
  crisis despite having the “best health care system on the planet,” as Gov. Andrew
  Cuomo claimed? In the last two decades, 18 hospitals have closed in New York City,
  a loss of more than 20,000 beds. And new health care facilities did not replace
  the shuttered sites, residential buildings did.
