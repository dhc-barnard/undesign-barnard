description: This book explores and critiques the process of spatial regulation in
  post-war New York, focusing on the period after the fiscal crisis of the 1970s,
  examining the ideological underpinnings and practical applications of urban renewal,
  exclusionary zoning, anti-vagrancy laws, and order-maintenance policing. It argues
  that these practices were part of a class project that deflected attention from
  the underlying causes of poverty, eroded civil rights, and sought to enable real
  estate investment, high-end consumption, mainstream tourism, and corporate success.
