description: The artist, Celestia Morgan, began reflecting on her hometown in Alabama,
  in regards to recent changes and neighborhood growth and decline. After doing research
  on the rather tumultuous and shameful history associated with redlining, she went
  on to produce art peices, often uing redlined and zoned maps, as it related to her
  personal experiences and wider grievances.
