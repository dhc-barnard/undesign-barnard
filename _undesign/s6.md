description: 'For 70 years, there stood a public housing community in Chicago known
  as Cabrini Green. Home to thousands, misunderstood by millions, Cabrini Green once
  towered over some of Chicago’s most expensive neighborhoods, a looming reminder
  of inequality and poverty. Cabrini’s high-rises were demolished as part of Chicago’s
  $1.5 billion Plan for Transformation, funded through the federal HOPE VI program.
  The result was an African American community cleared to make room for another social
  experiment: mixed-income neighborhoods. Shot over the course of twenty years, 70
  Acres in Chicago: Cabrini Green, directed by Ronit Bezalel, documents this upheaval,
  from the the fiery protests to save the complex, to the razing of the first buildings
  in 1995, to the clashes in the mixed-income neighborhoods that replaced it.'
