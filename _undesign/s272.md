description: Lack of knowledge of the aborigines and of their languages led to many
  errors on the part of the early explorers and settlers. Soon after the organization
  of the Bureau of American Ethnology in 1879, the work of recording a tribal synonymy
  was formally assigned to Henry W. Henshaw. The 2,500 tribal names and synonyms appearing
  in this list were taken chiefly from James Mooney's manuscript; the linguistic classification
  was the result of the work that the Bureau had been conducting under Henshaw's supervision.
  The handbook contains a descriptive list of the stocks, confederacies, tribes, tribal
  divisions, and settlements north of Mexico, accompanied with the various names by
  which these have been known, together with biographies of Indians of note, sketches
  of their history, archeology, manners, arts, customs, and institutions, and the
  aboriginal words incorporated into the English language. (Internet Archives; Bureau
  of American Ethnology)
