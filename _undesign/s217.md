description: The Red Line Archive is a mobile public art project that engages New
  York City residents in a conversation about race and the history of the 1938 Red
  Line Map that helped create the segregated urban landscapes of the city. This “cabinet
  of curiosities” is wheeled along city streets, inviting people to freely associate
  about personal artifacts and documents from the artist’s family history in gentrifying
  Brooklyn and ephemera collected during four artist walks in and along the periphery
  of redlined neighborhoods.
