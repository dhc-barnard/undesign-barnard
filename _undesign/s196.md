description: The Border and the Line takes up the central conceit of "the neighbor"
  to consider how the geography of racial identification and interracial encounters
  are represented and even made possible by literary language. Dean J. Franco probes
  how race is formed and transformed in literature and in everyday life, in the works
  of Helena Mar√≠a Viramontes, Paul Beatty, James Baldwin, and the writers of the Watts
  Writers Workshop. Exploring metaphor and metonymy, as well as economic and political
  circumstance, Franco identifies the potential for reconciliation in the figure of
  the neighbor, an identity that is grounded by geographical boundaries and which
  invites their crossing. (Stanford Univ. Press)
