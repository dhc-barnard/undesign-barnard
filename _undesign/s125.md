description: 'Detroit 48202: Conversations Along a Postal Route explores the rise,
  demise and contested resurgence of the "motor city" through a multi-generational
  choir of voices who reside in mail carrier Wendell Watkinsâ€™s work route. Blamed
  for the devastation - disinvestment to bankruptcy - but determined to survive, the
  community offers creative solutions to re-imagine a more inclusive and equitable
  city.'
