description: Spanning three centuries of Brooklyn history from the colonial period
  to the present, A Covenant with Color exposes the intricate relations of dominance
  and subordination that have long characterized the relative social positions of
  white and black Brooklynites. Craig Steven Wilder—examining both quantitative and
  qualitative evidence and utilizing cutting-edge literature on race theory—demonstrates
  how ideas of race were born, how they evolved, and how they were carried forth into
  contemporary society. (Columbia Univ. Press)
