description: 'BOSTON — There is brick dust everywhere: on shoes, on clothes, on the
  street. Most of it makes it into the field chalker, which has already marked three
  miles of sidewalk. There are six more to go, and over 1,000 pounds of the bright
  red chalk-and-brick mixture with which to refill the machine. As they walk, volunteers
  with the “Redlined” public art project are chanting and talking to curious passersby,
  who want to know: what exactly is redlining?'
