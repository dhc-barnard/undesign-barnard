description: The study of resilience is concerned with the ability to recover function
  after a disturbance. It is generally recognized that the ability to recover is not
  infinite and depends on initial conditions of the material that is stressed. Mindy
  proposes to set initial conditions for community recovery from climate change with
  the creation of the US Constitution, which enshrined that provision that slaves
  be counted as 3/5's of a person, making racism the "DNA of the nation." The recent
  expression of this DNA in policies of serial forced displacement and mass incarceration
  have, it has been argued, created a voracious machine of community destruction that
  is widening its reach from the initial victims in the African American community
  to much wider segments of the US population. This machine can push the ecosystem
  towards a permanent state of criminal enterprise hyperviolence, such as that seen
  in some parts of Mexico and Italy. Mindy suggests that remedies to climate change
  will be driven by this powerful social system, but other alternatives exist and
  should be pursued
