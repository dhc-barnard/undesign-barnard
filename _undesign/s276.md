description: 'During the post–World War II era, Columbia University undertook a bold
  and comprehensive expansion and redevelopment initiative to remake their immediate
  surroundings. Drawing upon the language of Cold War anticommunism, the university—in
  partnership with such redevelopment groups as Morningside Heights Inc.—undertook
  such a self-proclaimed ‘‘war on blight’’ in an attempt to ‘‘liberate’’ the surrounding
  community from the horrors of urban decay. This essay positions the 1968 student–community
  campaign against a proposed gymnasium in Morningside Park within this longer narrative
  of university-sponsored urban renewal. In light of such a history, those that campaigned
  against the university’s expansion efforts also adopted a language clearly influenced
  by the imagery of warfare in the mid-twentieth century: the language of anticolonialism.
