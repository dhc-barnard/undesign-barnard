description: The East New York Oral History Project was designed to capture the personal
  experiences of people who lived in East New York from 1960 - 1970, during the time
  in which East New York rapidly changed from a primarily White to primarily Black
  and Latino community. "Not only were the people moving in getting battered, but
  people moving out got battered as well. And real estate people were the ones really
  making the money...It's just sad because it divides people, and it did, it was a
  real division."- Mary Barksdale, East New York resident since the early 1960s
