description: 'Through a spatial analysis of 108 urban areas in the United States,
  we ask two questions: (1) how do historically redlined neighborhoods relate to current
  patterns of intra-urban heat? and (2) do these patterns vary by US Census Bureau
  region? Our results reveal that 94% of studied areas display consistent city-scale
  patterns of elevated land surface temperatures in formerly redlined areas relative
  to their non-redlined neighbors by as much as 7 °C...'
