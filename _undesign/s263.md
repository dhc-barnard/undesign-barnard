description: In the Shadow of the Ivory Tower takes readers from Hartford to Chicago
  and from Phoenix to Manhattan, revealing the increasingly parasitic relationship
  between universities and our cities. Through eye-opening conversations with city
  leaders, low-wage workers tending to students’ needs, and local activists fighting
  encroachment, scholar Davarian L. Baldwin makes clear who benefits from unchecked
  university power—and who is made vulnerable. In the Shadow of the Ivory Tower is
  a wake-up call to the reality that higher education is no longer the ubiquitous
  public good it was once thought to be. But as Baldwin shows, there is an alternative
  vision for urban life, one that necessitates a more equitable relationship between
  our cities and our universities. (Bold Type Books)
