description: A new kind of housing movement has been growing across America. In city
  after city, renters have begun to see themselves as a class, with shared interests
  and problems, and to organize together against evictions, profit-centered development
  and landlord disinvestment. When Covid-19 hit the United States, the country was
  already reeling from a severe housing crisis. Tenant organizers doubled their efforts.
  Now, with millions of Americans unable to make rent because of job losses or reduced
  work hours, national and local tenant organizers are calling for rents to be canceled,
  harking back to rent strikes that swept across cities during the Great Depression.
