description: 'An important and oftentimes conscientious aspect of a city’s social
  fabric is the way in which it houses its residents; you can learn a lot about a
  city from its real estate, and nowhere is this more true than it is in New York
  City. In this post I use data from a combination of New York City Department of
  Planning and Department of Finance datasets (PLUTO and RPAD) to try to answer a
  question popular in the media: who are the biggest landowners in New York City?
