description: In this collection of essays, Jackie Wang examines the contemporary incarceration
  techniques that have emerged since the 1990s. The essays illustrate various aspects
  of the carceral continuum, including the biopolitics of juvenile delinquency, predatory
  policing, the political economy of fees and fines, cybernetic governance, and algorithmic
  policing. Included in this volume is Wang's influential critique of liberal anti-racist
  politics, “Against Innocence,” as well as essays on RoboCop, techno-policing, and
  the aesthetic problem of making invisible forms of power legible.
