description: 'From article: "The city as we see it today did not happen by accident,
  but has been shaped and designed by policy, investment and intentions that predate
  most of us. To transform places for the better, these structures must be “undesigned”
  and their effects repaired. Undesigning systems and structures requires different
  thinking and creative innovation, both grounded in a deeper understanding of our
  shared history."'
