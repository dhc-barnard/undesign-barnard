description: This source explores the viral syllabus of John Hopskins professor, N.D.B.
  Connolly, as he tackles Trumpism. He, and other authors of his field, understand
  Trumpism as a, "personal and political gain marred by intolerance, derived from
  wealth, and rooted in the history of segregation, sexism, and exploitation." This
  explicitly ties to urban planning innitatives, as personal gains pollutes the authentic
  needs of various marginalized communities.
