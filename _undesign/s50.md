description: 'Community Futurisms: Time & Memory in North Philly* is a collaborative
  art and ethnographic research project exploring the impact of redevelopment, gentrification,
  and displacement in North Philadelphia through the themes of oral histories, memories,
  alternative temporalities, and futures. From May 2016-May 2017, BQF Collective operated
  Community Futures Lab at 2204 Ridge Avenue, which functioned as a gallery, resource
  and zine library, workshop space, recording booth, and time capsule, recording oral
  histories/futures in the North Philly neighborhood of Sharswood.'
