description: Chana Joffe-Walt searches the New York City Board of Education archives
  for more information about the School for International Studies, which was originally
  called I.S. 293. In the process, she finds a folder of letters written in 1963 by
  mostly white families in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. They are asking for the board to
  change the proposed construction of the school to a site where it would be more
  likely to be racially integrated. It’s less than a decade after Brown v. Board of
  Education, amid a growing civil rights movement, and the white parents writing letters
  are emphatic that they want an integrated school. They get their way and the school
  site changes — but after that, nothing else goes as planned.
