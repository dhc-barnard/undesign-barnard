description: The Autonomous City is the first popular history of squatting as practised
  in Europe and North America. Alex Vasudevan retraces the struggle for housing in
  Amsterdam, Berlin, Copenhagen, Detroit, Hamburg, London, Madrid, Milan, New York,
  and Vancouver. He looks at the organisation of alternative forms of housing—from
  Copenhagen’s Freetown Christiana to the squats of the Lower East Side—as well as
  the official response, including the recent criminalisation of squatting, the brutal
  eviction of squatters and their widespread vilification. (Verso)
