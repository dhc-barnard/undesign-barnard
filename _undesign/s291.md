description: At approximately 184,000 cars per day (cp. Dolnick 2010), the Cross-Bronx
  Expressway is known as one of the busiest roads in the United States (cp. ibid.).
  As its name already suggests, it runs across New York City’s borough of the Bronx.
  It is one of the major roads in the New York area and notorious for its congestion
  and the poor state it is in (cp ibid.). Most importantly, though, is that it is
  said to have been a major influence on the borough of the Bronx. Not only is it
  today regarded by many as an atrocity (see quote above), it is also claimed that
  the expressway is to blame for a negative development the area was subject to on
  a highly dramatic scale during the last century (cp. Dolnick 2010.). Then again,
  there are other voices that deny a link between the expressway’s construction and
  the downfall of the borough. The controversy that is thereby created will be the
  main issue of this paper. It will be dealing with the question whether any statements
  can be made regarding a connection between the expressway and the desolate state
  the Bronx was in during the middle of the last century. The following three chapters
  will be dedicated to give the information necessary to answer this issue, with respect
  to three major topics. In combination, this knowledge will be needed later, when
  different opinions and theories regarding the link between the Cross-Bronx Expressway
  and the negative development the Bronx underwent will be examined...
