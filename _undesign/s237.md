description: This Columbia Spectator article looks at Vernice Miller-Travis, a black
  Barnard alum, class 1980, who did the work to connect racism with enviornmental
  descrution and enviornmental privelege, effectively coining the term, "enviornmental
  racism". A significant amount of her findings can be connected to urban development
  and planning, as it relates to inequality and inequity.
