description: From the past thirteen years of annual Hike the Heights community potluck
  events to hundreds of walks through the parks of northern Manhattan, The CLIMB Chronicles
  tells the story of City Life Is Moving Bodies (CLIMB). Members of our CLIMB Consensus
  Group – neighbors of all ages and walks of life, students, researchers, organizational
  leaders, and even a few dogs – have contributed to CLIMB and Hike the Heights since
  2004. In the spirit of our community potluck approach – where everyone brings something
  to add to the celebration – we asked CLIMB Consensus Group members from over the
  years to share their stories, thoughts, and reflections. This book is the result.
