description: An investigation of the significant role that the black woman Margie
  Polite played in the Harlem riot of 1943, during which 6 African-Americans were
  killed and 180 people were injured. In this 1943 Harlem riot, Polite confronted
  a police officer in a public place at the inception of the riot. Conflicting accounts
  of Polite's role in the riot are found in police reports, the white press, the black
  press, sociological accounts such as Dominic J. Capeci, Jr.'s The Harlem Riot of
  1943, and Langston Hughes's poem, “The Ballad of Margie Polite,” published two months
  after the riot. In some of these accounts, Polite is cast in traditional feminine
  roles, while in others she is responsible for starting the riot. In fact, Margie
  Polite alerted America to Harlem's rage over systemic inequalities. Her protest
  and resistance sparked the violence of the riot, and her ex post facto silencing
  is illustrative of a general erasure of African-American women's participation in
  the pubic sphere.
