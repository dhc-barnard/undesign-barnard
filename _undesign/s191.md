description: In a provocative, sweeping analysis of American residential patterns,
  Loewen uncovers the thousands of “sundown towns”—almost exclusively white towns
  where it was an unspoken rule that blacks could not live there—that cropped up throughout
  the twentieth century, most of them located outside of the South. These towns used
  everything from legal formalities to violence to create homogenous Caucasian communities—and
  their existence has gone unexamined until now. For the first time, Loewen takes
  a long, hard look at the history, sociology, and continued existence of these towns,
  contributing an essential new chapter to the study of American race relations. (Touchstone)
