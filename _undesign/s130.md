description: Although dramatic scenes of residential integration abound within midcentury
  American fiction, this essay makes the case for attending to less spectacular narratives
  of residential segregation, including forms, manuals, and maps that captured the
  more impersonal processes of observation used to uphold the more generally steady-state
  of US residential apartheid. In turning to the category of the report at the heart
  of this material, I argue that neighborhood observation at midcentury was an inherently
  racialized act that not only responded to race but changed the ways it was counted
  and valued. Focusing on three types of reports—a series of appraisal manuals designed
  to train burgeoning appraisers in racial reading, Jane Jacobs's Death and Life of
  Great American Cities (1961), and Gwendolyn Brooks's urban reportage, "They Call
  It Bronzeville" (1951), questioning the mechanics of neighborhood observation in
  the wake of its professionalization—I insist that the story of how systems of neighborhood
  and racial appraisal shaped one another is not just one for historians and urbanists
  to tell. It is also, fundamentally, a story about how idioms of perception, value,
  and taste undergirding home ownership and neighborhood value in the United States
  have been organized by race.
