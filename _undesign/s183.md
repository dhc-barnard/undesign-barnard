description: This paper investigates "A Night-Club Map of Harlem," illustrated by
  E. Simms Campbell in 1932. Only recently purchased and made available by the Beinecke
  Library at Yale University, Campbell's map has been largely ignored by art historians
  of The Harlem Renaissance and American modernism. As a visual document of the interracial
  nightlife that characterized Harlem in the early twentieth-century, however, the
  map offers us new information regarding the way the physical space of Harlem became
  abstracted into a signification for both white and black New Yorkers. In the following
  pages I attempt to draw out the ways that Campbell illustrates Harlem as a space
  that has the ability to both cement white voyeurs' membership in a modern intelligentsia
  and foment black ontologies of resistance. In doing so, the social history of racialized
  space in Manhattan, slumming, and cartography will also be considered. I aim to
  describe how Campbell's map represents Harlem as a neighborhood that is comprised
  of white and black identity formation where both both races were able to construct
  subjectivities simultaneously and often in opposition to one another.
