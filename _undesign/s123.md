description: 'From article: "An epidemic hits, and as it ripples through our cities,
  it alters how we see our surroundings, prompting us to ask: How must we reshape
  our built environments to prevent another outbreak? Historically, in the United
  States, the way planners, politicians, and developers have answered this question
  has followed an insidious pattern, in which those who live in housing that’s vulnerable
  to the spread of an illness are themselves pathologized, and then displaced. The
  flawed housing is demolished and rebuilt to be more hygienic, but priced to exclude
  its former residents, who must again find shelter in dangerous housing."'
