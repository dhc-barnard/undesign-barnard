description: 'From website: "UDP collaborated with the Strong, Prosperous, and Resilient
  Communities Challenge (SPARCC) to assess local dynamics around gentrification, displacement,
  and exclusion in Chicago, in close collaboration with local partners. We hope that
  the resulting map of our neighborhood change typology will empower Chicago communities
  to better understand their trajectories and stabilize their resident population."'
