description: When Ivory Towers Were Black lies at the potent intersection of race,
  urban development, and higher education. It tells the story of how an unparalleled
  cohort of ethnic minority students earned degrees from a world-class university.
  The story takes place in New York City at Columbia University’s School of Architecture
  and spans a decade of institutional evolution that mirrored the emergence and denouement
  of the Black Power Movement. Chronicling a surprisingly little-known era in U.S.
  educational, architectural, and urban history, the book traces an evolutionary arc
  that begins with an unsettling effort to end Columbia’s exercise of authoritarian
  power on campus and in the community, and ends with an equally unsettling return
  to the status quo. (Fordham Univ. Press)
