description: Gowntown investigates the impact of Columbia University's massive expansion
  into Upper Manhattan and proposes strategies of transformative leverage to generate
  broad community benefit and counter a spreading urbanism of trickle-down and gentrification.
  Terreform's multi-scalar design is grounded in a planning paradigm focused on carefully
  crafted-as well as spontaneous-institutional, social, and environmental connections,
  inspired by the public possibilities of one of the world's great concentrations
  of educational, medical, cultural, and community assets. Gowntown is addressed to
  all the people living, working, and studying uptown, presenting a collection of
  ideas that radically bridge the familiar-and too often hostile-divide between gown
  and town (Terreform).
