description: The anniversary of the Tulsa race massacre has shined a new light on
  the case for reparations. Andre Perry, senior fellow with the Brookings Metropolitan
  Policy Program, a scholar-in-residence at American University, and a columnist for
  the Hechinger Report, breaks down what reparations would look like and how a town
  in Illinois may be creating the framework for national reparations. (WNYC)
